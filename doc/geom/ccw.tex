{\scriptsize This algorithm is also known as \emph{CCW}.}

\begin{tcolorbox}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be arbitrary \emph{distinct} points on a plane.
        \item The orientation of $A$, $B$, $C$ is counterclockwise if $\overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{BC} > 0$, and clockwise if $\overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{BC} < 0$.
        \item If the cross product is zero, then the three points are on a line.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

This is a direct derivation from the cross product of 2D vectors.
