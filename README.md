# Problem Solving Handbook (Kcits970)

When I learn algorithms for computational problem solving, I often forget their correctness proofs and only remember the algorithm itself. To mitigate this issue, I created this handbook to collect proofs of algorithms that I have learned, or may learn in the future. Example implementations are included in the code directory, but it should be noted that this handbook focuses more on correctness and logical reasoning than implementation.
